  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Quasi voluptas dolor nam fugit excepturi velit!
    Dignissimos porro deleniti nobis? Sunt vero provident at qui ducimus quae aperiam temporibus amet nostrum,
    itaque nulla omnis hic?</p>

  The strong element is for content that is of greater importance, while the b element is used to draw attention to
  text without indicating that it's more important.
  <strong>This is a bold text that is of greater importance than normal bold text and demands more attention from the
    user than that of bold text.</strong>
  <b>This is a normal bold text.</b>

  The em tag is used to draw the reader's attention to the text and suggests that the enclosed text should be spoken
  with a higher pitch and with a slightly drawn out and more emphasized voice compared to a regular sentence. The i
  tag, on the other hand, is used to render text in an italicized font.
  <em>This is a italic text that is of greater importance than normal italic text and demands more attention from the
    user than that of the normal italic text.</em>
  <i>This is a normal italicized text.</i>

  The u tag is used to create underlined text.
  <u>This is some underlined text.</u>

  We can add subscript and superscript in HTML as follows.
  <p>H<sub>2</sub>O is subscript text.</p>
  <p>x<sup>2</sup> is superscript text.</p>

  HTML ignores multiple spaces in the written code. But if we want to display some text as-is in the written format,
  then we can use the pre tag.
  <pre>
    This is
    written as-is



    it is written
    in the HTML code.
  </pre>
